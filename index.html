            <p class="banner-description">You need to have faith, and only when you hold on to it that 
            even the ‘impossible’ turns out to be ‘possible.’ It is important to understand that all 
            things are possible for the one who believes! You need to work ahead with a belief that no 
            matter how many hurdles come along your way, things aren’t going to turn impossible. ©
